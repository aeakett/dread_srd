<h1 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: A Question of Character</h1>
<p class="introFlav">I rode in silence as Mark drove us north through that autumn evening. He refused to turn on thestereo, and I refused to discuss my condition any further. I knew my decision would not set well with his Catholic upbringing, but with all that we had seen, his concern for the hereafter seemed a bit out of place.</p>

<p class="introFlav">Carol dozed off intermittently in the back seat as the first few stars began to twinkle through the charcoal clouds, but she was awake enough to see it first. All she said was “huh,” in a half question, but it was enough to make my spine run cold. I shifted in the front seat, and craned my neck to see her bruised face. She was staring out into the dark fields that ran alongside the highway, tracing her finger along the window. Following her gaze, I saw a lone figure dancing in the amber glow of a lit billboard.</p>

<p class="introFlav">It appeared to be a clown.</p>

<p><span class="initCap">T</span>he players’ characters stand at the center of any <span class="dread">Dread</span> game. Just like the main characters in a novel or movie, the plot revolves around them, and it is what happens to them that is most important. Therefore, the players’ characters are often far better defined than any of the other characters involved in the story. It is necessary to create these characters before any game so that the players and host can reach an agreement on what they can do and how they should be played. The host may also find it very useful to know what sorts of roles will be played so that they can tailor the story around these characters.</p>

<div class="marrow"><img class="marrowTop" src="img/top.svg" />
<h2 id="thedutiesofaquestionnaire">The Duties of a Questionnaire</h2>
<p>A good questionnaire will provide the following:
<li>Information about what the character is capable of</li>
<li>Information about what the character is not capable of</li>
<li>A hook that invests the player in the character</li>
<li>A way to tie the character into the plot of the story</li>
<li>A way to tie the character to the other players’ characters</li>
<li>And a reason for the character to hope.</li>
</ul></p>
<img class="marrowBottom" src="img/bottom.svg" /></div>

<p>These characters exist in three forms: as roles the players interpret through play, as characters understood by the host, and as simple lists of questions and answers designed to reconcile the first two forms. This chapter deals mainly with the questionnaire itself. From here, the players should be able to develop their interpretations, and the host an understanding of the characters. It all starts with the questionnaire.</p>

<p>The host should create the questionnaires beforehand in order to tailor the characters to the story they have planned. Each character should have a unique questionnaire. Basically, a questionnaire is a page or so of questions, with plenty of room for answers, that attempt to define the character well enough for play. Do not ask too many questions, or you will spend most of your game sifting through the answers. With practice, both creating a questionnaire and character can become easy and rewarding parts of the game, though it may seem daunting at first.</p>

<h2 id="creatingaquestionnaire">Creating a Questionaire</h2>
<p>Creating questionnaires is more art than science. You will have to take into account the needs of the story, your players, and the characters themselves. Each requires something different from the questions. The story needs leading questions that tie the characters into the plot and each other and questions that can help the characters through some foreseeable hardships or expose them to greater danger. The players need questions that they can sink their teeth into, which lead to interesting answers and inspire them to breathe life into their characters. These create characters the players can invest themselves in—characters worth caring about. Without this investment, the players simply won’t care if they lose their characters. And the characters need questions that can flesh them out, defining their strengths and limits. The characters need to have their capabilities well defined in the questionnaire to avoid slowing down play with discussions on just what the character can and cannot do. Above all, the characters need a reason for hope, or they won’t care if they are lost to a tumbling tower.</p>

<p>Ask questions that deal with a character’s habits and daily life. Ask questions about occupations, hobbies, achievements, and goals. Ask questions about disabilities, weaknesses, addictions, and failures. Find out what shames a character, what excites a character, and always what a character fears.</p>

<p>Perhaps the one thing that every character questionnaire must address is why the character participates in the story. What is it about this character that keeps him or her from quitting? There will be moments in most <span class="dread">Dread</span> games when a character has the chance to turn tail on their friends and escape whatever horror they face. It may occur while trying to out run a fearsome and spectral predator or when the characters uncover a cache of medical supplies with a surplus of morphine. Why not let the ghostly beast consume your allies? Why not inject yourself with enough narcotics to forget it all? What is it that keeps the character in the game?</p>

<div class="flesh">
<h2 id="topicsthatcouldbeaddressedinaquestionnaire">Topics that Could Be Addressed in a Questionnaire</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do you behave?</li>
<li>How do you look?</li>
<li>How do you relate to the other characters?</li>
<li>What are your fears?</li>
<li>What are your habits?</li>
<li>What are your hobbies?</li>
<li>What are your strengths?</li>
<li>What are your weaknesses?</li>
<li>What do you do for a living?</li>
<li>What do you own?</li>

<li>What keeps you from giving up?</li>
<li>What makes you happy?</li>
<li>What makes you sad?</li>
<li>What is your name?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="flesh">
<h2 id="intrusivequestions">Intrusive Questions</h2>
<p>The most efficient way to get to the core of a character is to offer at least one intrusive question. These are the questions that no one is comfortable answering in real life. Many times these questions will never come up during the game; but they offer an incredible hook for the players, and for that reason, they are invaluable. Here are some samples. Some of them could be defused with easy answers, but players should be encouraged to seek the harder truths about their characters.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the worst thing you have ever done to a loved one?</li>
<li>It is said that everyone has a price—how did you discover yours?</li>
<li>Why are you married if you aren’t in love?</li>
<li>Why won’t your family acknowledge your existence?</li>
<li>Who else knows you are a fraud?</li>
<li>How come you no longer allow yourself to have pets?</li>
<li>Why do you feel responsible for the loss of a loved one?</li>
<li>Who has hurt you most over the years and why do you deserve it?</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="flesh">
<h2 id="suggestedquestionnairestructure">Suggested Questionnaire Structure</h2>
<p>Ultimately, how you structure your questionnaire should reflect what works best for you and your players. This can be done differently for each questionnaire. There are times, however, when having a predefined structure can help you come up with questions faster and without worrying about leaving anything out. Here is one such structure. Feel free to make your own or disregard the idea of structures altogether.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask about a job, career, or some other defining trait.
   <ul><li>This should address the bulk of what the character is capable of and it should include some sort of hook that allows the character to be different than others with the same career</li></ul></li>
<li>Ask about another skill or talent such as a hobby or sport.</li>
<li>Ask for a psychological deficiency or dependency.
   <ul><li>This doesn’t have to be drastic, and in fact could just be something quirky about the character.</li></ul></li>
<li>Ask for a reason to find courage or hope.</li>
<li>Ask how this character relates to the others.</li>
<li>Ask about personality or appearance.</li>
<li>Ask about a relative or loved one.</li>
<li>Ask for a fear.</li>
<li>Ask about religion, politics, or worldview.</li>
<li>Ask about gear, favorite possessions, or wealth.</li>
<li>Ask for a weakness or vulnerability.</li>
<li>Ask for a survival technique or ability.
   <ul><li>This doesn’t have to be positive. Many people survive by avoiding problems in self-destructive ways.</li></ul></li>
<li>Ask for a name.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>After all, if the character doesn’t want to be in the game, the player might as well topple the tower and be done with it.</p>

<p>If you are building a game with certain types of characters in mind, ask leading questions that tie characters to the motives, careers, or social standings that you require. What did you steal from your employer just before you were fired? What is it about your love life that you fear your mother may discover? With all this cash, how do you fend off boredom? Each of these questions immediately says something about the character, but doesn’t exactly tell the whole story. Leave room for surprises.</p>

<p>That bears repeating: leave room for surprises. Try to leave as many important details as possible about the character up to the player. If you need someone who starts the game in a hospital, let the player decide whether they are a janitor, nurse, security guard, paramedic, pharmacist, doctor, patient, a loved one visiting a patient, or what have you. The key is to let go of control. Perhaps the player in the above example wants to play a mafia button-man who is looking to put the squeeze on an ill witness in protective custody. This opens up all new possibilities for the game. What if, during an outbreak of a horribly contagious and fatal disease, a police officer recognizes him and tries to apprehend him? The answers players come up with often add whole new layers of pressure on the character.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of leaving questions open-ended. Ultimately, it is up to the host whether or not to approve any answer a player puts on a questionnaire. This way, the questionnaire can ask “You have mystical control over what?” and the player won’t be able to answer “The world,” unless the host wants to allow that answer.</p>

<p>Through the questionnaire, you can leave some details of the story up to the players. “What feral animal almost killed you when you were a child, and how does this encounter still stay with you?” In a game where the antagonist is a lycanthrope, the answer to the question could prove very useful. The more details you draw out of the characters’ questionnaires, the easier it is to draw them into the story.</p>

<p>There is really no hard and fast rule on how many of which types of questions you should use in a questionnaire, but as a general guideline, a baker’s dozen or so should be enough. To make things easy on you, try to spend equal time on the character’s capabilities, shortcomings, personality and appearance, psychology, and social interactions with the other characters. It is also recommended that you include a question or two about what belongings they might have with them at the beginning of the story and of course, don’t forget to ask about the name.</p>

<p>Remember, though, the more questions you ask, the more you will have to read through to find that important detail in the middle of the game.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble thinking of questions, you will find over a hundred and fifty examples along the bottoms of these pages. Simply flip through the book to a random page and see if any of the questions inspire you. If not, look at the next or previous one, and see if the combination sparks an idea.</p>

<h2 id="samplequestionnairefromarisendeadgame">Sample Questionnaire from a Risen Dead Game</h2>
<p>Here is an example questionnaire to examine—later we will look at how these questions can be answered. These are from a game that takes place a month or two after the dead have risen and torn the civilized world apart. Since this apocalypse, the characters have been forced into a grim and harsh survival.</p>

<p>This particular questionnaire was written with the intent to exemplify the differences between life before the apocalypse and after.</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="question">1. Before the apocalypse, what job did you hold at a dot-com company, and what did you enjoy most about it?</p>
<p>It is often a good idea to start off with a question that addresses the broadest details about the character. Here we have asked about the character’s previous job and what special skills they might have possessed at the job. This will give the player a chance to illustrate some of the character’s abilities as well as provide a framework from which the other questions can be answered.</p>

<p class="question">2. How do you think the others treat you differently because you are the youngest in the group other than the child?</p>
<p>When the players begin this particular game, their characters will have already known each other. Questions like these help define the relationships between the characters, so the players know where to start. They can also help to create friendships or rivalries among the players’ characters. Also, this question establishes some facts about the group, such as the presence of a child and the relative age of this character. The host of this game wanted everyone to know about the child right away because the child could be used to hold the group together.</p>

<p class="question">3. What drug are you now addicted to and why do you keep it a secret?</p>
<p>Questionnaires should address the faults of the characters as well as their strengths. In this particular game, the host wanted to make the stark new reality and its affects on the human psyche a central theme. The questionnaire reflects this by giving most of the questions a psychoanalytical edge. The hope is that the players will spend time considering how the rise of the dead has affected their characters’ lives.</p>

<p class="question">4. Is the emotional impact of the apocalypse lightened by the fact that you are now more physically fit than you ever have been, or do you feel guilty for taking pleasure in this fact?</p>
<p>Like the previous question, this one deals with how the character’s psychology has changed since the rising of the dead. It also gives the player something else to work with if a physically demanding task comes up during the story—very handy in a game that will most likely involve a lot of running.</p>

<p class="question">5. When you have trouble sleeping, what pleasant memory do you focus on?</p>
<p>The host created this question in order to provide something hopeful or light-hearted in what would otherwise be a grim life. The goal was to subtly give the player a reason for the character to continue in this harsh world. Some players may need more than this to work with. If that was the case, the host could have asked the more obvious question: “What memories do you have that give you hope for the future?” There is nothing inherently wrong with either question—it just depends on the player. If, as a host, you are unsure, err on the obvious side for a question this important.</p>

<p class="question">6. Of all the family members and friends you lost to the dead in the first few days of the apocalypse, whom do you miss the most and why?</p>
<p>Questions about the past, especially concerning regrets, fears, or lost loved ones, are always good. They help to flesh out the character and they provide fuel for horrific encounters in the course of the story. In this case, the host was toying with the idea of having an apparition haunt the players’ characters. If each character had a similar question, the host could pick the most effective one.</p>

<p class="question">7. Do you let the others know about that thrill you get from the adrenaline rush that accompanies a battle with the dead, and how does this rush affect how you fight?</p>
<p>This is another hint that this character could become a physical powerhouse. The host is expecting the players’ characters to be fighting the dead for a good chunk of the story. Questions like these will not only help the characters survive, but will help the host decide on what may or may not require pulls while the characters are engaged in battle.</p>

<p class="question">8. You depend on the others for survival because of your lack of what vital ability?</p>
<p>Like the question about the drug addiction, this one forces the player to explore some of the character’s weaknesses. Players can sometimes be reluctant to see their character in a negative light, which makes these questions vital. Perhaps more importantly, this question gives the character a reason to stick with the group and help everyone survive, something this host wants to encourage.</p>

<p class="question">9. Whom do you feel closest to in the group and who do you believe doesn’t like you?</p>
<p>This is the third question that deals with relations with other players’ characters and the group dynamic. Not all games will need this many, but this time the host wanted to focus on reasons why the characters would look out for each other. It also creates a little tension, which is perfectly fine. When answering this sort of question, it is recommended that the player wait until everyone is ready to introduce their characters to everyone else. It will then be easier to find a character that matches each part of the question.</p>

<p class="question">10. What’s in your pockets?</p>
Rarely do characters begin the game naked, and there is a reasonable amount of items that could be assumed a character would have, even if they weren’t listed on the questionnaire. But questions like this one allow the players to introduce unique and perhaps vital items. As with all the answers on a questionnaire, the host has to approve this one, just to make sure a stray assault rifle doesn’t find its way into a story set in the fog-choked alleys of Victorian London.</p>

<p class="question">11. What part of yourself do you find most embarrassing?</p>
<p>The answer to this question will give the player a way to play the character in a social role. If the answer is a physical feature, such a large nose, everyone will have a better idea of what the character looks like. If the answer is something else, such as the character’s inability to speak to members of the opposite gender or the character’s age, then this will most certainly come out during play when the character is interacting socially.</p>

<p class="question">12. What do you think you are better at than you really are?</p>
<p>The answer to this question will not only provide the host with something to trap the character with, it will also give the character’s player more to work with in social situations. But mostly, it is just a fun question and will generate entertaining moments in the game.</p>

<p class="question">13. What is your name?</p>
<p>Finally, the player is asked to provide a name for the character.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="fillingoutaquestionnaire">Filling Out a Questionnaire</h2>
<p>When filling out a character questionnaire, you should always assume the presence of a silent “and why?” at the end of each question. It will create a better understanding of the character. The answer will cover more ground, and there will be less room for misunderstanding during the game itself. The more times you ask yourself “and why?” about any of the questions, the further and further you fall into the depths of the character. To take a seemingly innocuous question and apply an exaggerated example:</p>

<p>“What’ll you have to drink?” Whiskey, on the rocks. “Why?” Because I’m a weary man with little use for frivolous and fruity drinks. “Why?” Because I have seen things that have made me question my own sanity. “Why?” It is the nature of my occupation to scour the world for things we were not meant to know. And so forth.</p>

<p>You do not have to answer all of the silent whys in print, but considering them will help you answer other questions.</p>

<p>The goal to filling out a questionnaire is not to create a character that will survive and thrive in any environment the host throws at you, but to create an interesting character that makes the story worth participating in. To this end, consider what sorts of flaws your character will have to heroically overcome, and try to bring them out in your answers. Try to provide reasons for why your character would want to survive the story and make connections with the other characters. The game is a struggle and without such reasons and connections, there is no point in playing. Keep in mind that whatever answers you supply will have to be approved by the host.</p>

<div class="marrow"><img class="marrowTop" src="img/top.svg" />
<h2 id="howtoanswerthequestions">How to Answer the Questions</h2>
<p>To create an appropriate character, try to follow these tips when filling out a questionnaire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume the question ends with a few more “and why?” or “How?” questions.</li>
<li>Don’t try to make an invincible character.</li>
<li>Tie your character in with the other characters.
   <ul><li>You can wait until all the characters are introduced before you answer the questions about the other characters.</li></ul></li>
<li>Create a character with flaws that need to be overcome.</li>
<li>Give your character a reason to survive.</li>
<li>Most of all, create a character you want to play.</li>
</ul>
<img class="marrowBottom" src="img/bottom.svg" /></div>

<p>If you are stuck on the answer to a certain question, move on and return to it later, or ask the host for clarification. You may also find that you will have to wait for details about the other characters as well. For that matter, other players may ask you about your character. If all the players are present, you can go ahead and ask them. Alternatively, everyone may decide to wait until the rest of the questionnaires are filled out, introduce their characters, and then answer the interpersonal questions. There is no need to share information you do not feel the other characters would or should know. Try to be as helpful as possible without revealing any important character secrets.</p>

<h2 id="sampleanswersfromarisendeadgame">Sample Answers from a Risen Dead Game</h2>
<p>Here is one example of how a player might fill out the sample questionnaire from above. The comments are interspersed, and explain why these answers are useful and how they may help in the game.</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="question">1. Before the apocalypse, what job did you hold at a dot-com company, and what did you enjoy most about it?</p>
<p class="answer">I was a database programmer working on correlating large amounts of data about the shopping habits of our customers’ customers. You couldn’t imagine a less exciting job. Debugging was about the only thing that kept me alive. I love that investigative shit.</p>
<p>Answering in first person may help a player get a feel for the character’s voice, which seems to have happened here. The debugging comment indicates that the character has an affinity for methodical detective work, which may come into play during the story.</p>

<p class="question">2. How do you think the others treat you differently because you are the youngest in the group other than the child?</p>
<p class="answer">Not too differently now, I made damn sure of that.</p>
<p>While this answer appears to go against the spirit of the question, it is not altogether a bad answer. The player’s conception of the character does not include him being fawned upon, ignored, or patronized, and this is made clear in the answer. Plus, it still gives the character some depth by implying that there was a time in the past when this was an issue. Since the host didn’t feel that it was essential to the story that this character be treated differently, this answer was approved.</p>

<p class="question">3. What drug are you now addicted to and why do you keep it a secret?</p>
<p class="answer">Nicotine. Smoking is a filthy habit, and I don’t want the child picking it up. I’m pretty sure the child thinks of me as a big brother.</p>
<p>This answer is a good example of answering the silent “and why?” at the end. The question requires that the player write at least the first two sentences, but the third brings the idea together and offers a relationship that would be interesting to play. The child isn’t named or even given a gender in this answer because the player who is playing the child’s parent hasn’t filled out that questionnaire yet. The player can fill that information in later, if necessary.</p>

<p class="question">4. Is the emotional impact of the apocalypse lightened by the fact that you are now more physically fit than you ever have been, or do you feel guilty for taking pleasure in this fact?</p>
<p class="answer">Both. It is survival of the fittest and I make no excuses for delighting in my survival, but deep down, I’m afraid it is just bravado.</p>
<p>There isn’t much wiggle room in this question for the player. Obviously the host wanted the character to be physically fit and wanted the character to be concerned about it. With questions like these the important part is just to consider how it affects your understanding of the character.</p>

<p class="question">5. When you have trouble sleeping, what pleasant memory do you focus on?</p>
<p class="answer">Christmas time. Hopefully we will be able to celebrate the holiday again.</p>
<p>This is another example of the player supplying more than is asked for. Goals like this one are also great ways to give your character a reason to keep going in the face of the horrors they will experience.</p>

<p class="question">6. Of all the family members and friends you lost to the dead in the first few days of the apocalypse, whom do you miss the most and why?</p>
<p class="answer">My little sister. We always stuck up for each when we were growing up, and I feel personally responsible for losing her. Perhaps this is why I care so much for the child.</p>
<p>Another opportunity to make a connection with the child, which is great, but this answer actually brings up more questions. In this case the host asks the player to provide a little more information on the sister.</p>
<p class="answer">She’s four and half years younger than me and had just started college when the dead rose. Her name was Carol, but we called her Carl because she would mispronounce her own name as a child.</p>

<p class="question">7. Do you let the others know about that thrill you get from the adrenaline rush that accompanies a battle with the dead, and how does this rush affect how you fight?</p>
<p class="answer">I’m too vocal about the thrill during the fight—always shouting insults that fall on dead ears. Afterwards, however, I deny the thrill and try to pretend I am more somber than I really am. I prefer to fight up close with the dead. They can’t sneak up on you if you are in the middle of them.</p>
<p>Much like the answer to the fourth question, this answer makes for a complex and rich personality. The character isn’t just a dead-destroying machine. He has fears, both of being surprised by the dead and of being exposed as enjoying this too much.</p>

<p class="question">8. You depend on the others for survival because of your lack of what vital ability?</p>
<p class="answer">Acquiring and preparing food. I just can’t get the hang of hunting, foraging, and cooking.</p>
<p>The host may point out to the player that because the dead only rose months ago, there is still plenty of canned goods to be scavenged from abandoned houses and stores. But the character is already tied pretty firmly to the group through the child, and eating nothing but canned goods will eventually wear on him. So this answer should work.</p>

<p class="question">9. Whom do you feel closest to in the group and who do you believe doesn’t like you?</p>
<p>At this point, the player leaves this blank and plans on answering it once everyone has been introduced.</p>

<p class="question">10. What’s in your pockets?</p>
<p class="answer">A Swiss army knife, a Leatherman multi-tool, a lucky silver dollar, a lighter, two packs of cigarettes, and <s>a .45 magnum with extra clip</s>.</p>
<p>The host approves all of these items except for the gun. While it is conceivable that these survivors would have guns, the player already indicated that the character preferred to fight in close quarters. The two of them discuss the matter and decide to list a machete instead, which fits better with both their understandings of the character—even if it doesn’t fit in a pocket.</p>
<p class="answer">And I always carry a machete with me.</p>

<p class="question">11. What part of yourself do you find most embarrassing?</p>
<p class="answer">My body odor. Rarely do we get the chance to maintain the same level of hygiene we all had before the dead rise, but I’m sure I’ve suffered the worst for it. Whenever possible, I avoid standing too close to the others, for their sake.</p>
<p>An answer like this not only gives the player another hook when it comes to playing the character, but it gives the host a chance to put this character in some awkward situations. What if all of the characters were held up in a closet, hoping that a roving band of dead will pass them by? Whether or not this character actually smells, will he be embarrassed enough to face the dead alone just to give the others some fresh air?</p>

<p class="question">12. What do you think you are better at than you really are?</p>
<p class="answer">Stealth. I simply don’t realize how much noise I make.</p>
<p>Another answer that should give the host ideas for what to throw at the players.</p>

<p class="question">13. What is your name?</p>
<p class="answer"><s>Chuckles.</s></p>
<p>The host felt such a silly name might detract from the game, and asked the player if he thought it was appropriate. The player decided it was a nickname.</p>
<p class="answer">Charles “Chuckles” Thompson.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="playingyourcharacter">Playing your Character</h2>
<p>Once you have completed the questionnaire it is time to introduce your character to the other players. At this point, you should reveal any information their characters may know about yours. Just how much usually depends on the characters’ relationship with each other. The host should let everyone know if and how they know each other. Answers to questions about character relationships will also have an impact. In the end, you should play by ear and makes sure you don’t reveal anything that is meant to be a secret. Those can come out during the game.</p>

<p>Generally, the host will start the game by telling you and the other players about where their characters are, what they have been doing just before the game started, and what the world about them looks, sounds, feels, and smells like. While the host narrates the story, you and your fellow players should explain what your characters are doing. There is no order to this unless the host says that there needs to be. Try to give everyone an opportunity to participate, but don’t sit back and let the story happen without you. Jump in.</p>

<p>During the game, you will be responsible for controlling your character’s intentions. You can decide exactly what the character wants to do and how the character plans on doing it. However, things will not always go according to plan. From time to time the host may step in and require that you pull some blocks in order for your character to do what you want your character to do. Or, if the host thinks whatever your character is attempting is too unreasonable, it may be prohibited altogether. When the host makes these sorts of judgments, you are allowed to argue your character’s case, to a point. If you feel that the host has overlooked an ability that is clearly detailed on the questionnaire, or if you don’t think the host fully understands how the character will accomplish the task at hand, you are welcome to bring these things up. Ultimately, the host is the final arbiter. If you state your case and the host still disagrees, you must live with their ruling.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why the host’s rulings on character actions are final. The first is simply to save time and eliminate stress. Lengthy arguments about what imaginary people can and can’t do are no fun to anyone. The second is because the host knows more-intimate details about the story. You may think that because your character is a professional mechanic, she should be able to fix the getaway car in no time flat; but you won’t realize until much later in the story that an alien virus is clouding her brain. The host shouldn’t have to reveal such details until the appropriate time, so as a player you will have to trust the host’s judgment.</p>

<p>When playing your character, keep the questionnaire on hand so you can reference it. Try to speak as your character would (though if your character has a voice too far removed from your own, no one will blame you if you speak normally instead of in a comical pitch or accent). Playing a <span class="dread">Dread</span> game is in some ways similar to improvisational theater. Everyone is more likely to enjoy the game if they are in character. Keep in mind what is written on your questionnaire. There will be opportunities to showcase behaviors and quirks that were developed from the answers you came up with.</p>

<p>Remember to stay as true to your character as possible. Don’t consider what you would do in any given situation; consider what your character would do.</p>

<h2 id="playervscharacter">Player vs. Character</h2>
<p>When you know somethingthat your character should not, you need to pretend you don’t know it. Or rather, you must not play the character as if they know it. This is much harder than it sounds. The game isn’t ruined if you forget to maintain this separation of knowledge, but you should try to be aware of it. For the most part, it can be assumed that characters know many of the everyday things that their players know. That is, assuming the game is set in roughly the same time and culture as the players. If you were playing serfs in feudal Europe who are being hunted by a demented lord and his entourage, then obviously your characters would not know how to change the tires on a car. Fortunately, this situation is not likely to rise in such a game.</p>

<h2 id="helpingthehost">Helping the Host</h2>
<p>When you fill out your character’s questionnaire there will be several opportunities for you to help the host out. Mainly, you want to make your character’s abilities and drawbacks as clear as possible. This way there will be less discussion about what the character can and can’t do during play.</p>

<p>You will also want to give your character the sort of flaws that will lead to interesting dilemmas in the game. This not only gives the host something to work with, but also allows you to control a bit of the story you want to tell with your character.</p>

<p>Finally, you want to make a character that will interact with the other characters. This interaction doesn’t have to be positive all the time, but there needs to be a reason for the character to be with them. For some games, this will be obvious—everyone is trapped in the same haunted asylum trying to find their way out. For others it may require a little more help from the players. Everything will run more smoothly in these games if you create a character that has a reason to work with or use the group.</p>

<p>In fact, many times the opposite occurs. The characters in the feudal game could very easily know how to slaughter and dress a wild animal they caught while on the run, even if the players do not. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, and the players shouldn’t be required to describe what their characters are doing in such detail that they run the risk of doing it wrong. They could just say their characters are preparing the animal for eating. The host should be satisfied with this.</p>

<p>Occasionally, a player may realize that their character would understand or notice something that the player wouldn’t even know to look for. An example of this would be a character who works as a forensic crime scene investigator. The player may not know that the blood splatter patterns on the wall are not consistent with eyewitness accounts of the murder. The player may, however, suspect something is amiss. In this case, the player may electively pull a block to have the host bring the clue to their attention. This doesn’t guarantee that the host will have something for you, but at times it is better safe than sorry.</p>

<div class="flesh">
<h2 id="chatter">Chatter</h2>
<p>One way to reduce some of these gaps between player and character knowledge is to reduce the amount of discussion between players that isn’t occurring between characters. The temptation to talk to the other players about what is happening in the game and how you plan to deal with it is great. However, if plans and agreements are made between players whose characters aren’t able to communicate with one another, the suspension of disbelief in the game breaks down. To avoid this, you could play with this rule:</p>
<p><em>If you aren’t telling the host what your character is doing, than your character is also saying what you say.</em></p>
<p>This should keep the out-of-character discussions to a minimum. There is no need to be draconian about enforcing this rule unless it really gets out of hand.</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most disruptive schism between player and character knowledge is not when the player has had the benefit of some experience or education that the characters hasn’t, but when the player suspects something the character shouldn’t. During a <span class="dread">Dread</span> game you will have those moments when a character should open a door and you, as the player, know that something horrible waits just beyond. Resist the urge to play the character as if they know this. The game is much more enjoyable when boneheaded characters do boneheaded things—even if it gets them into devastatingly bad situations.</p>

<p>That said, you could ask the host to allow your character to have an idea that they normally wouldn’t. If the player really wants the character to know something the player knows—something it is unlikely but not impossible for the character to know—an elective pull may convince the host to allow it.</p>

<h2 id="beyondthenight">Beyond the Night</h2>
<p>Dread characters do not have to end when the story does. Many of them can offer more than a single night’s distraction. If you were to play in a series of stories set in the same place over several nights, you might want to reuse the characters you had previously. In this way, the game can be like a comic book, novel, or television series. However, no one survives a Dread game without changing. To represent the sorts of changes a character may experience there are several things you will want to do. First, take careful notes during the game. If something happens to or has an affect on your character, write it on the questionnaire. The guidelines for these notes can be found in the previous chapter in <a href="chapter2.htm#dealingWithTheConsequences">Dealing with the Consequences</a>, <a href="chapter2.htm#recordingTheConsequences">Recording the Consequences</a>, and <a href="chapter2.htm#expandingCharacters">Expanding Characters</a>.</p>

<p>Second, the host should provide each player with a few extra questions at the end or beginning of each complete story the character is involved in. Unlike questions for new characters, these don’t have to be so well thought out. In fact, the host may ask the same questions of each character:</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="question">What have you learned from your previous ordeal?</p>
<p>This gives the players a chance to improve their characters in a way that reflects the experiences they had during the story.</p>

<p class="question">What long-term harm did you sustain in your previous ordeal?</p>
<p>Scars, wounds, and psychological traumas that are not likely to heal any time soon should be recorded after this sort of question. To properly answer this question and the next one, the host should tell the players how much time has passed between games.</p>

<p class="question">What have you been up to since the last ordeal?</p>
<p>If it has been a while since the story took place, the characters may be at very different points in their lives. Some might have gone back to school. Some may have lost their jobs. Some may have spent more time at the gym. Some may have started families. These details will be important to the new character.</p>
</div>

<p>The host is not tied to these questions and may try to direct the growth of the characters with more leading ones—especially in the case of the last question. In fact, if a lot of time has passed between stories, the host may expand the last question into several questions that are more like the sort of questions asked of beginning characters.</p>

<p>Whatever questions are used, the goal is the same: find out how the characters have been changed by their story and how they have changed since it was resolved.</p>

<p>Eventually, your character may take up more than a single sheet of paper. That is, if you have a steady hand.</p>

<p>If you find your questionnaire has grown and it is no longer conveniently packaged on a single sheet of paper, feel free to reduce it all to a single sheet of notes. But hold on to the original, just in case.</p>

<div class="flesh">
<h2 id="whenisastoryover">When is a Story Over?</h2>
<p>During a long running series of stories, it may be hard to tell when one story ends and another begins. If you were playing the risen dead game used as an example for the questionnaire, your characters may have to survive innumerable horrors before any real resolution can be found. So, how can one tell when a story is done?</p>

<p>There is no hard and fast rule to this. Basically, if a story feels done, it is done. Or, if in the middle of a story several months pass without significant action, the host may offer more questions. In fact, just about any time the host feels it is appropriate, they can ask more questions of the characters. If the players feel that, after several nights of playing the same characters, they should get a chance to answer more questions, they should ask their host for more. More questions never hurt anyone.</p>
