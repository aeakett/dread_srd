Dread is a horror game. There is no reason that the content of any game of Dread need be any more horrifying than you wish it to be, and therefore Dread
can be suitable for nearly any age. However, the contents of this book delve into mature topics at points, in order to facilitate groups who enjoy those sorts of horror, so please exercise discretion when passing this book around. In particular, Chapter 11 is not suitable for our younger players.

<h1>Chapter 1: To Begin With</h1>
<p class="introFlav">I remember watching the mugs as I gingerly attempted to carry the coffee to the bereaved, without spilling it on their immaculate living room carpet. Within a breath, the steam disappeared and the dark fluid frosted over. A chill crept across my neck and I looked up to see poor, little Lucy standing just outside the window. For a moment it all seemed a horrible mistake. It was not her body the police found alongside that hateful highway. She had simply been lost, as we first suspected, and just now found her way home.</p>
<p class="introFlav">I was about to relay the good news to the Kohlmans and the reverend when I saw their faces blanch as they stared at me … rather, just beyond me. That was when I realized that it wasn’t Lucy outside, but her reflection against the darkened window. Soon I would learn that both the police and I were correct. That was Lucy’s body in the ditch, and she did indeed find her way home.</p>

<p><span class="initCap">D</span><span class="dread">read</span> is a game of horror and hope. Those who play will participate in a mutual telling of an original macabre tale. The goal of <span class="dread">Dread</span> is to sustain the delicate atmosphere that invokes the hand-quivering emotion that lends its name to the game.</p>

<p>The thrill of a <span class="dread">Dread</span> game lies within the tension between desire and loss. You will take on the role of people trapped in a story that is only as compelling as it is hostile—people who will find themselves making decisions we hope never to face in real life.</p>

<h2>The Warning</h2>
<p>So, it should be said that <span class="dread">Dread</span> is not necessarily for everyone. The main purpose of any game is to have fun. Like a good game of Truth or Dare, <span class="dread">Dread</span> should make you uncomfortable from time to time. If this does not sound like fun, then please do not play.</p>

<p>If, however, you crave a game that savors alienation, tension, anxiety, fear, and all those other delicious emotions that draw an audience of millions to horror novels, stories, comics, and movies each year, then by all means, enjoy.</p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>During a <span class="dread">Dread</dread> game
you and your friends
will create characters to populate your own brand of horror story. It may take several hours to accomplish this, or even several nights, and it will require some preparation. Within this book you will find a set of rules and guidelines that will help you with this endeavor. However, it is important that you remember the ultimate goal is the story itself. If any part of this book or its contents gets in the way, feel free to ignore or alter it as you see fit.</p>

<p>To play, you will need yourself and at least one other person, though it is recommended that you gather about five to six players in total. The majority of you will be playing the roles of characters caught in a tale of horror—one character to a player. One of you will have the fortune (fair or foul) to host the game. Who among you shall take up this mantle is a choice for your group to make. All players have responsibilities in the game, but the host’s duties are unique. The host will create the basic framework for the story and will be the arbiter of all the conflicts the characters find themselves in. The host will also take on the roles of all the other characters that aren’t played by the other players. Because the duties of the host are slightly more involved, the majority of this book is dedicated to them.</p>
=========
<div class="flesh">
   <h2>The Tower</h2>
<p>The tower is a pile of fifty-four 1”x½”x3” wooden blocks stacked three to a level, in alternating directions, eighteen levels high, that can be purchased commercially under the brand name Jenga®. If you do not already own this fairly ubiquitous game, it is readily available in the game and toy sections of most stores. If you wish to create your own, we encourage you to experiment with your own dimensions and send us photos of the completed set.</p></div>

<p>In addition to players, you will need a sturdy, flat surface; plenty of scratch paper; pens or pencils; and the tower (see sidebar and the next chapter). It may also be useful to have this book handy—at least for the first few times you play. Eventually, once your group finds its particular style and rhythm, you will find this book useless. In fact, it can become a hindrance if you are constantly referencing it. Once that happens, we encourage you to pass it on.</p>

<h2>The Ambience</h2>
<p>When you are ready to play, you will want to set aside a sufficient amount of time and meet at an appropriate place. To maintain a horrific atmosphere you should begin with the proper environment. A dark, quiet place will work best. You will need light enough to read by, but little more. You may wish for some mood music. Try to avoid anything with obtrusive lyrics, keep the volume low, and make sure you bring enough to avoid it becoming repetitive. Since many <span class="dread">Dread</span> games can take four or more hours, this may take some planning. The key to making both the lighting and the music work is to keep it subdued. Don’t let them detract from the game itself. Candles can add to the atmosphere, but avoid placing them on the same surface as the tower or where someone may knock them over. You may also want to have food and drink handy, so the game isn’t interrupted by a quest to sate such carnal desires.</p>

<h2>The Book</h2>
<p>Throughout these rules you will happen upon two different sidebars: the marrow and the flesh. Both serve to clarify concepts in the game but do so in their own fashion. The marrow is meant to be a quick reference, a distillation of the contents of the page. The text is repeated in simplified language to make it easier to find the foundations of the rules during play or a swift search of the book. The flesh will expand on the page’s content, offering examples, insight, or other materials. They exist to develop the basic concepts in the rules in ways that should assist you in understanding them.</p>

<p>The rules in the next ten chapters are divided into three sections. The next two chapters (Briefly, the Rules and A Question of Character) are a basic overview of rules that all players should have some familiarity with. The fourth and fifth chapters (How to Host a <span class="dread">Dread</span> Game and How to Create a <span class="dread">Dread</span> Game) are dedicated entirely to the tasks of the host, and most players need not bother with them. The final six chapters are also aimed at the host, but may not be pertinent to every <dread>Dread</dread> game. They are a collection of tips and guidelines that will assist the host in using various common horrific themes and elements in his stories. Finally, there is an appendix covering alternatives to Jenga®, and then three ready-to-run <dread>Dread</dread> scenarios.</p>

<h2>Support</h2>

There you should be able to find the answers to frequently asked questions, contact information for support, and additional material for the game as it becomes available. We also have an email list to announce upcoming releases and new editions of the game, as well as an online forum in which you can discuss topics related to <dread>Dread</dread> with other players.</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: Briefly, The Rules</h1>
<p class="introFlav">At dusk the untended cornfields began to ripple and heave. We expected the creatures to spill into the bare patch of backyard that separated the house from the fields. But they didn’t.</p>

<p class="introFlav">Their wheezing howls, that inhuman crescendo, like teeth on chalkboards … We had only a dozen or so shots left and Grant, who had swallowed the last of his medicinals earlier that morning, began to shake. He kept asking, “Why won’t they come? Why won’t they come?”</p>

<p class="introFlav">I called upstairs to Megan, hoping she could calm the old man the way she calms her kid. It was about that time when the first of those damned things stumbled into the clearing, dragging Megan’s exterminator uniform behind it like a child drags a rag doll.</p>

<p><span class="initCap">B</span>efore you play <dread>Dread</dread>, there are preparations to be made. First, one among the players must host the game. It is the job of the host to provide the framework for the game and to adjudicate the actions of the other players’ characters. Just exactly how one provides the framework and adjudicates actions is detailed in the following chapters. For now, let us just say that the host will have to prepare notes before everyone gathers for the game.</p>

<p>To clarify, the host of the game does not have to be the host of the party. You do not need to play at the host’s home and the host is not necessarily responsible for refreshments. Those duties are beyond the scope of this rulebook, and players should fight amongst themselves over them.</p>

<p>The other players should create their characters. The next chapter will delve into this more deeply. Essentially, the players will each fill out a questionnaire provided by the host. The questions should deal with what the characters are capable of, physically, mentally, and emotionally, and should help all the players better understand their roles.</p>

<h2>The Game Proper</h2>
<p>Once the host has had time to prepare and the players have finished their character questionnaires, you will be ready to begin the game. Find a flat surface or table somewhere everyone can sit comfortably. Before you begin, each player should introduce their character to the rest of the players. Avoid revealing too much about the character, such as secrets or details that aren’t readily apparent. Just discuss what the other characters would know. The exact amount will differ from game to game. Some characters may be old friends who are almost an open book to each other, while others could be complete strangers.</p>

<h2>The Metaphor of the Tower</h2>
<p>In order to play <dread>Dread</dread>, you will also have to assemble the tower, both metaphorically and physically. As mentioned before, <dread>Dread</dread> is a game of horror and hope. The latter emotion is as vital a part of the formula as the former. Without hope, horror is only despair. To create dread, you must be able to balance that sickening cold swimming in your gut with the glimmering chance of survival lying just at the tip of your out-stretched fingers. Every significant action in <dread>Dread</dread> is resolved through a metaphor of this balance, even if the elements of horror and hope have not yet shown themselves in the story. This is accomplished through the tower.</p>
==========
<p>At the beginning of the game, the physical tower should be placed upon your flat surface in a spot all the players agree on. You will want it easily accessible, but not precarious. Everyone except the host needs to be able to easily reach it. As will be explained in a moment, the tower holds a terrible threat and you should treat it with care.</p>

<p>If you are playing with fewer than five players (not including the host), you should pre-pull three blocks for every player less than five. This is the only time when you are immune to the effects of a collapsed tower (see below). If the tower tumbles during this part, simply rebuild it and try again—you obviously need the practice.</p>

<h2>The Game Begins</h2>
<p>The host sets the scene as if they were telling a story. As the story progresses, the other players should contribute by explaining what their characters are doing and asking questions for clarification. Throughout the game, the host’s job will be describing what goes on in the world around the characters and the players will be describing their characters’ actions and reactions.</p>

<p>There is no formal structure to this part of the game, which will most likely be the majority of it. The host has complete control over everything in the story except the other players’ characters. The players may, and in fact should, interrupt to describe the actions taken by their characters. They have complete control over their own characters, but cannot control anything beyond the actual intention to act. The success, failure, and consequences of the actions are up to the host and the tower (see below).<p>

<p>During the game, all the players, including the host, should try to stay true to their characters.</p>

<marrow>
<h2>Preparing for the Game</h2>
<ul>
<li>Decide who will host.</li>
<li>The host should prepare their notes for the story.</li>
<li>The host should create a unique questionnaire for each of the players’ characters.</li>
<li>Players should fill out the character questionnaires.</li>
<li>The players should introduce their characters to the rest of the players.</li>
<li>Do not to reveal any information the other characters wouldn’t know.</li>
<li>Stack the tower and pre-pull 3 blocks for every player you have less than 5.</li>
</ul>
</marrow>

<p>Choices should be made based on what would be appropriate for the character to do, and not necessarily what the players would want to do. There will be times when the player knows something that the character obviously would not know. This is when it is especially important to maintain the differences between player and character. The next chapter will delve deeper into this topic, but for now keep in mind that the players are pretending to be people other than themselves, and should act accordingly.</p>

<h2>Resolving Conflict</h2>
<p>While many of the things the characters do will be clearly possible, some of them may not be. Any time a character attempts something that they may not be able to do, or that the current situation may aggravate, their player must pull a block from the tower.</p>

<p>What does this mean? For the most part, anything that a character would clearly not be in danger of failing would not require a pull. Conversely, anything that the character clearly can’t do, would fail. However, frequently a character will be in such a situation where they have to accomplish something they could possibly succeed or fail at. For example, most folks can jump, and would be able to jump forward a few feet without a pull. But could the character make the leap from one rickety beam to the next in a roof of a burning barn? Or, if the character is a well-educated scientist, could they translate an ancient text written in Latin?</p>
============
<marrow>
<h2>Pulling</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must use 1 hand at a time, though you may switch hands at any time.</li>
<li>The block being pulled must be from beneath the topmost complete layer.</li>
<li>After it is pulled, the block must be placed atop the tower, aligned in the opposite direction of the blocks in the layer beneath it.</li>
<li>Place it within the topmost layer if it is incomplete.</li>
<li>After placing the block on top, wait a few moments to see if the tower will collapse.</li>
<li>Players may change their minds about what part of a complex action a particular pull represents at any time during the process.</li>
</ul>
</marrow>

<p>In the first example, given enough time and preparation,
there really shouldn’t be a problem with
letting the character make the jump. However, time
is not an abundant commodity in a blazing barn,
and the beams themselves might not be stable.
This particular act requires about as much luck
as it does skill from the character. In the second
example, the character’s questionnaire probably
specified the fact that the character was educated,
but not all educated people can read Latin. In both
these cases, the host can request a pull for success.</p>

<marrow>
<h2>Abandoning the Pull</h2>
<ul>
<li>At any time during this process the player is allowed to abandon the pull.</li>
<li>If the player abandons a pull, the character fails at the action the pull represented.</li>
<li>If the tower collapses because of a pull that was abandoned, the character is still removed from the game.</li>
</ul>
</marrow>

<p>What if the jumper had been an acrobat in the circus, or the would-be translator had extensively studied the Latin roots of botanical and biological  nomenclature? There may be evidence on the questionnaire that a character stands a better chance of success than normal. Players should help the host along, by bringing up any details about their characters that may influence the situation. However, the decision of whether something is pertinent is up to the host. A circus acrobat is definitely used to working under pressure and in dangerous environs. Such a character might not need a pull to make their leap successful. The majority of the scientific names for plants and animals are in Latin. It is likely that someone studying this naming system could also have studied Latin in a more general fashion, even if the questionnaire does not specifically address this.</p>

<h2>Pulling a Block</h2>
<p>The act of pulling a
block must be done
with one hand (although the player is allowed to switch hands mid-pull, only one may be touching the block at any given moment), and the block must be pulled from beneath the topmost complete layer. Then the block must be placed on top of the tower, laying in the opposite direction of the blocks on the row beneath it. If this is done without causing the tower to collapse, then the character’s act is successful. For particularly unstable towers, you may want to wait a moment or two before declaring the action a success. At any time during this process the player is allowed to change their mind and abandon the pull. If this happens, the character does not succeed at what they are trying to do. Abandoning the pull, however, does not make you immune to the effects of a collapsed tower (<span class="formatMe">see The
Collapsing Tower [p. 9]</span>).</p>
===========
<p>Ultimately, it is up to the host to decide whether or not a pull is required, and just exactly what a successful pull means. For the leap, a single pull may mean making it to the next beam, or it may mean being able to hop from beam to beam until the character reached safety—especially if the character has an acrobatic background. For the Latin, it could mean that the character knew enough to understand some of the text, or even just identify what the text may be about, or it could mean that the character did indeed study Latin and is quite fluent in it.</p>

<p>If the player refuses to pull a block, then the character’s attempt fails. This can result in any number of consequences, but none of them may remove the character from the game. The reading character will most likely find the text indecipherable. The leaping character may end up on the barn floor, in the middle of an inferno, with a freshly broken arm.</p>

<p>The exception to this is if the player offers some way to change the circumstances surrounding the task at hand so that they are more beneficial. Perhaps they can get other characters to help, take their time to accomplish the task, find a tool that will aid in the endeavor, or use any number of other useful tricks. Essentially, it is as if the character realized the task would be too much, and tried a different approach. Because it represents a change in the character’s mind, it may take a little time in the story, and if time is limited during that point in the story, the character may end up failing before their plan is put into action.</p>

<h2>The Collapsing Tower</h2>
<p>If at any time a player other than the host causes the collapse of the tower, their character is removed from the game. It should be noted that this occurs regardless of who is or isn’t pulling, or even if the tower falls accidentally. If they were attempting to pull a block at the time, the character also fails at that action.</p>

<flesh>
<h2>Expanding Characters</h2>
<p>As the game progresses, characters will make pulls for abilities the players weren’t sure they had. In the Latin translation example <span class="formatMe">[p. 8]</span>, there is a good argument for the scientist to be able to read Latin, but nobody will know if he can until after the player either successfully pulls or refuses to pull. In such cases, you may want to make a note of the result on the character’s questionnaire. That way, if a similar incident occurs later in the game, or in another game with the same character, you will have more information to work with. Take a look at the section entitled Dealing with the Consequences <span class="formatMe">[p. 14]</span> for more information on this.</p>
</flesh>

<p>How this will play out in game is up to the host. Usually, this will result in the death of the character, but may involve any number of events including imprisonment, loss of consciousness, flight of cowardice, insanity, possession, etc. It should not be difficult to dream up various and sundry graphic ways to remove the jumper. However, the translation attempt may cause the host some difficulty. How do you remove this character and still preserve the reality of the game?</p>

<p>For this you may have to look at the surrounding circumstances. What is the book? Is it a loathsome, ancient tome that reveals secrets the human mind was not meant to know? Then the character could have slipped into a fit of supernatural insanity, or fled in terror upon discerning the book’s secret. (Note: A strict interpretation of the rules would indicate that, because the character is supposed to have failed, they could not have translated the book and therefore could not have been driven insane. This, however, can be overlooked for the sake of a good story. After all, the character will have still failed to do anything useful with the book’s knowledge.)</p>

<p>Perhaps the book is a red herring, nothing more than an ancient cookbook. How, then, can the host remove this character? If there is no environmental danger involved, the host may have to turn to a more mundane way of excusing the character from the game. Take a quick look at the character’s questionnaire. Is there a close relative, friend, or other loved one listed? The character could receive a phone call with dreadful news about the loved one, forcing the character to leave immediately for an out-of-town hospital.</p>
====================
<flesh>
<h2>Ways For a Character to Leave the Game</h2>
<ul>
<li>Die,</li>
<li>Flee in terror,</li>
<li>Fall into a catatonic state,</li>
<li>Become imprisoned,</li>
<li>Be called away to visit a sick loved one,</li>
<li>Be possessed by a malignant spirit,</li>
<li>Become monstrously transformed,</li>
<li>Get knocked unconscious,</li>
<li>Get trapped in a cave-in,</li>
<li>Become hospitalized,</li>
<li>Get called in to work a double shift,</li>
<li>Become drugged or inebriated,</li>
<li>Get grounded by over-protective parents,</li>
<li>Become paralyzed,</li>
<li>Be prematurely aged by fear,</li>
<li>Be crippled in a car accident,</li>
<li>Get chased off by fellow characters because of poor manners,</li>
<li>Arrive too late for the ship’s departure,</li>
<li>Be ejected from the ball for forging an invitation,</li>
<li>Leave to find a better career,</li>
<li>Join a cult,</li>
<li>Regress to a child-like state,</li>
<li>Become seized by a paranoia strong enough to cause them to fear the other characters,</li>
<li>Realize that they are also putting their family in danger,</li>
<li>Become stricken with grief,</li>
<li>Become embarrassed to the point of flight,</li>
<li>Or be consumed with uncontrollable joy.</li>
</ul>
</flesh>

<p>Sometimes, there really is no readily-available way to remove a character from the game. If this is the case, there are still some options available to the host, and they are detailed in Chapter 4: How to Host a <dread>Dread</dread> Game <span class="formatMe">[p. 28]</span>.</p>

<p>Once the tower has collapsed, you will need to set it back up like you did at the beginning of the game, but this time you should pre-pull an additional three blocks for every character that has been removed from the game so far. These prepulls should be distributed as evenly as possible between the remaining players, because the tower is live and if it collapses during these pre-pulls, another character will be lost.</p>

<h2>The Sacrifice</h2>
<p>There will be times when the tower seems too shaky to approach, and the players are loath to try anything that requires a pull. After all, if they try something and the tower falls, not only do they lose their character, but their character will also fail. But it doesn’t have to be this way. There is one last, desperate option. If a player deliberately knocks the tower over, their character succeeds in a dramatically appropriate way just before being removed from the game. Just exactly what is dramatically appropriate is dependent on the situation and ultimately up to the host of the game.</p>

<h2>Complex and Difficult Tasks</h2>
<p>Sometimes when the character is attempting something more complex—or particularly difficult, but still possible—the host may request more than one pull. In this case, each pull should represent a significant portion of the task. The player does not need to make each pull, and may pick and choose which pulls represent which significant portions of the action. The player may even change their mind about what a pull represents at any time. For instance, a character who is not very experienced in first aid or dealing with pain is trying to apply a tourniquet to his own leg. The host could require two pulls for this action: one to correctly apply the bandage and the other to overcome the pain. The character’s player starts to pull for the pain first, but soon realizes that the tower may not be stable enough for two pulls. Instead, the player can decide that the first pull is for the first aid attempt and suffer the consequences of not pulling to endure the pain (which could result in yelping loud enough to alert a stalking menace, briefly passing out, etc.).</p>
=======
<p>When taking on complex or difficult tasks, it is entirely likely that the player may not be aware of the result of each pull. This is especially appropriate when characters take on complex tasks they are untrained in, or when a task is surprisingly more difficult than they would expect.</p>

<p>An example of a character in over their head would be a layperson removing a bullet from a wound with an artery in the way. If the character isn’t aware of the artery, the player shouldn’t be. In this case the host can ask the player to make another pull to avoid “complications.” The player doesn’t need to suspect that there are any complications (indeed, there might not be), but it is reasonable to be asked to pull again considering the difficulty of the task and the character’s lack of experience. The complications themselves are not detailed, so the player never really learns anything they shouldn’t.</p>

<marrow>
<h2>Complex and Difficult Tasks</h2>
<ul>
<li>The host can request more than one pull for a complex or difficult action.</li>
<li>Each pull should represent a significant step in the task.</li>
<li>At any time before, during, or immediately after any pull, the player may decide which portion of the action they are pulling for.</li>
<li>The player does not need to pull for every portion of the action.</li>
<li>Players need not know what a particular pull is for, if their character would not.</li>
</ul>
</marrow>
=========
<p>A trained surgeon would know about the artery, but may not know that the patient has a rare allergy to the anesthetic being used. In these cases, asking for another pull will most likely alert the player that there is something wrong. After all, the character should be able to handle the situation with a minimum of pulls. In this case, the host may opt not to offer the pull. This is one of the reasons why players are allowed to make pulls electively (see Elective Pulls <span class="formatMe">[p. 14]</p>). If the player does ask to make an elective pull, the host can assume the character is investigating for further complications. At that point, it may be appropriate to tell the player what the pull is for.</p>

<h2>Conflict between Players’ Characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended that this method should not be used for most conflicts between players’ characters, especially verbal ones.</li>
<li>When a character tries to do something rash or violent to another, the other usually can avoid it.</li>
<li>If a player doesn’t want the action to be avoided, they can risk one or more pulls from the tower:</li>
<li>The player of the first character willing to step up the conflict should pull one or more blocks and declare their intentions toward the other character(s).</li>
<li>The intent of the pull cannot be so drastic that it would remove the other character from the game. This is only possible through a collapsed tower.</li>
<li>The player of the target must either accept the action, or pull to defend.</li>
<li>If this player then decides to retaliate, they have the option to pull again and declare their intentions against the other character(s).</li>
<li>This process continues until one side refuses to pull, or the tower collapses.</li>
<li>If the tower collapses during this conflict, the character of the player responsible is removed from the game.</li>
</ul>
</marrow>

<p>For this reason, the host may occasionally ask for pulls to overcome a vague obstacle. The pull must always accomplish something, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be something important or life threatening. It just has to be useful. A host may ask the players to pull to “notice anything unusual” when they first enter a library. The players may fear a lurking killer or some other trap, but it may just be the fact that the books are shelved in a random order (indicating it had been ransacked for a secret book and then hastily re-shelved).</p>

<h2>Conflict Between Players&rsquo; Character</h2>
<p>Not all characters get along, nor should they have to. Character conflict is just a natural byproduct of the stressful situations <dread>Dread</dread> characters find themselves in. The vast majority of character conflict can be resolved without using the tower—especially debates, heated arguments, and physical posturing. The host, through interpretations of the characters’ actions and what is known about the characters from their questionnaires, usually resolves these sorts of conflicts. There are times, however, when things get heated. Usually, the resolutions that don’t involve the tower are not entirely decisive – at least not as decisive as it would have been if a character had been removed from the game. One character may be tempted to turn things up and do something rash or violent. If it is appropriate for the character to take the sort of risk that is involved with pulling, then all characters involved have trouble on their hands.</p>

<p>Essentially, if a player says his character does something to another character, the player of the other character can describe how their character avoids it. If both actions are reasonable, given the circumstances, then the aggressor’s attempt is avoided. That is, unless the player of the aggressor is willing to pull for it.</p>
===========
<p>The player of the aggressive character, the one willing to up the ante, has the option to pull a block from the tower. Then they may declare exactly what the pull is meant to accomplish. It can be anything as long as it doesn’t necessitate the removal of another character from the game. One character can fire a pistol at another character, because there is a chance of the bullet only wounding them. One character cannot place a gun against another character’s head and pull the trigger, because this would most likely be fatal. However, in the second example, the gun-toting character can <em>try</em> to place the gun against the other character’s temple and perhaps the gun could go off in the struggle temporarily blinding the other character. That way something has happened, but the character isn’t removed from the game.</p>

<p>Just like any other pull, the host may request more than one pull if the action is particularly difficult or complex; and, just like any other pull, each pull represents a portion of the action being completed.</p>

<p>To defend against the action, the targeted character’s player can pull. Usually only one pull is needed, no matter how many pulls the aggressor made. However, if the defender is out-matched or caught under bad circumstances, the host may request more pulls. Once again, each pull represents a portion of the defense, which should in some way protect the character, but not completely. The defender is allowed to pick and choose which pulls are which, like normal. If the defender has made their pulls, then the aggression is avoided – or at least lessened, if only a portion of the pulls are made.</p>

<marrow>
<h2>Mismatched Opponents and Circumstances</h2>
</ul>
<li>If one character clearly has an advantage over another, their player may not be required to make some of the pulls.</li>
<li>If this character is the aggressor, then their player must make at least one pull.</li>
<li>Likewise, the disadvantaged character’s player may have to pull more than once.</li>
<li>Which pulls aren’t required depends on the nature of the character’s advantage, and should be decided by the host.</li>
</ul>
</marrow>

<p>If the two players’ characters are not on equal footing when it comes to the conflict, the host may reduce the number of pulls required from the player whose character has the advantage. Or the host may increase the number of pulls required from the player whose character is disadvantaged. In both cases, there should be a reason for why each individual pull is either required or removed. For example, if an asylum orderly with experience subduing people is wrestling with a rather non-athletic college professor, the host may decide that the orderly’s player has to pull once to grab and pin the professor, but the professor’s player needs to pull twice, once to avoid the pin and again to break the orderly’s hold. It is important to note that no matter how much of an advantage one player’s character has over another, if that character is the aggressor (trying to do something to the other character and not just reacting to something the other character is trying to do to them), at least one pull must be made by their player. There are no free assaults on other players’ characters.</p>
============
<flesh>
<h2>Some Possible Reasons to Electively Pull<h2>
<ul>
<li>To be extra aware in a situation;</li>
<li>To accomplish a task swiftly without sacrificing quality;</li>
<li>To improve the chances of having the drop on someone;</li>
<li>To exert extra effort while holding a door closed;</li>
<li>To ask the host for a clue or idea you don’t have, but your character might;</li>
<li>To improve the accuracy or lethality of an attack;</li>
<li>Or to avoid a hazard you suspect, but your character isn’t currently aware of.</li>
</ul>
</flesh>

<p>The conflict ends when both players decide to back down and cease their dangerous game of chicken. Of course, it can also end with the collapse of the tower, and the usual consequences. Because this can lead to hard feelings between players, it is highly recommended that the players’ characters try to reach an understanding before this dire result.</p>

<flesh>
<h2>Recording the Consequences</h2>
<p>When recording consequences on your character’s questionnaire, you may want to leave room for the changes. You could create boxes to group related consequences together, so that all the notes that relate to your character’s physical health are in one section and all the notes that relate to their mental health are in another, and so forth. This makes things easier to find and can give you a broad understanding of your character’s current condition with just a glance.</p>
</flesh>

<h2>Elective Pulls</h2>
<p>Players always have the option to pull a block without being asked to. There are a number of reasons why one may want to do this. It essentially represents the player’s character putting forth more effort than they would normally put forth on a given task. The player should indicate just in what way the character’s extra effort is being used, but the host ultimately decides how it affects the story.</p>

<p>As an example, if your character were fleeing from room to room in a well-furnished Victorian manor in the late evening, with only a candle to light their way, it might be wise to pull a block to ensure that the character is paying close attention to table corners, open cabinets, chair legs, and other objects likely to cause a stumble or twisted ankle. By pulling and telling the host this is the case, you can increase your character’s chances of avoiding such pitfalls without slowing down significantly or otherwise hindering your character’s progress. You could simply tell the host your character plans to keep an open eye for such things, but the host may rule that such activities can slow your character’s flight or distract your character from other important details. Electing to pull always represents an effort above and beyond what the character is normally capable of.</p>

<h2>Dealing with the Consequences</h2>
<p>Throughout the course of a story a great many things will happen to the characters. Many of these things, such as injuries, loss of loved ones, promotions at work, irrational fears or nervous habits born out of traumatic stress, learning the hideous secrets of an ancient cult, etc., will have a lasting effect on the characters’ lives. When such things happen, the player should make a note of it on their character’s questionnaire. Rather than rely on our memory, especially when a single story could take several nights to tell, it is better to have a written record. There are no rules to govern what should or shouldn’t be noted, beyond common sense. However, if you are going to note something, it is recommended that you explain briefly how it happened, so that memories can be jogged if need be.</p>
======
<p>Many of the consequences noted in this fashion will change over time. People heal from injuries, whether they are social, emotional, or physical. And situations can worsen—a drugged character could slip further into dementia, illness can worsen, debts increase, and so forth. When this happens, it is best to cross out the previous condition or circumstance with a single line so that there is no confusion as to which is currently in effect, but there is still a historical account available.</p>

<marrow>
<h2>During the Game
<li>The host describes all that happens to and around the characters.</li>
<li>Players contribute by declaring what their characters are doing.</li>
<li>The player must pull if their character is attempting to do something the character is conceivably capable of, but that is either:</li>
<li>Outside the character’s realm of experience, or,</li>
<li>Performed under aggravated conditions.</li>
<li>If the player declines to pull, their character fails at whatever action they are attempting.</li>
<li>This failure cannot be so drastic that it would remove the character from the game.</li>
<li>Exception: If there is time in the story to do so, the player may avoid the pull by changing the circumstances so they are more beneficial. Their character need not fail outright:</li>
<li>If the circumstances change enough to make the task easy to accomplish, the character succeeds.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the player may still be asked to pull.</li>
<li>If the player pulls successfully, the character succeeds.</li>
<li>If at any time during the game a player causes the tower to collapse, their character is removed from the game. If the character was attempting an action at the time, they fail.</li>
<li>Exception: If the player deliberately knocks the tower over, their character succeeds in a dramatically appropriate way, but is still removed from the game.</li>
<li>Once the tower tumbles, restack it and pre-pull three additional blocks for every character removed from the game so far.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chapter 3: A Question of Character</h1>
<p class="introFlav">I rode in silence as Mark drove us north through that autumn evening. He refused to turn on thestereo, and I refused to discuss my condition any further. I knew my decision would not set well with his Catholic upbringing, but with all that we had seen, his concern for the hereafter seemed a bit out of place.</p>

<p class="introFlav">Carol dozed off intermittently in the back seat as the first few stars began to twinkle through the charcoal clouds, but she was awake enough to see it first. All she said was “huh,” in a half question, but it was enough to make my spine run cold. I shifted in the front seat, and craned my neck to see her bruised face. She was staring out into the dark fields that ran alongside the highway, tracing her finger along the window. Following her gaze, I saw a lone figure dancing in the amber glow of a lit billboard.</p>

<p class="introFlav">It appeared to be a clown.</p>

<p><span class="initCap">T</span>he players’ characters stand at the center of any <dread>Dread</dread> game. Just like the main characters in a novel or movie, the plot revolves around them, and it is what happens to them that is most important. Therefore, the players’ characters are often far better defined than any of the other characters involved in the story. It is necessary to create these characters before any game so that the players and host can reach an agreement on what they can do and how they should be played. The host may also find it very useful to know what sorts of roles will be played so that they can tailor the story around these characters.</p>

<marrow>
<h2>The Duties of a Questionnaire
<p>A good questionnaire will provide the following:
<li>Information about what the character is capable of</li>
<li>Information about what the character is not capable of</li>
<li>A hook that invests the player in the character</li>
<li>A way to tie the character into the plot of the story</li>
<li>A way to tie the character to the other players’ characters</li>
<li>And a reason for the character to hope.</li>
</ul></p>
</marrow>

<p>These characters exist in three forms: as roles the players interpret through play, as characters understood by the host, and as simple lists of questions and answers designed to reconcile the first two forms. This chapter deals mainly with the questionnaire itself. From here, the players should be able to develop their interpretations, and the host an understanding of the characters. It all starts with the questionnaire.</p>

<p>The host should create the questionnaires beforehand in order to tailor the characters to the story they have planned. Each character should have a unique questionnaire. Basically, a questionnaire is a page or so of questions, with plenty of room for answers, that attempt to define the character well enough for play. Do not ask too many questions, or you will spend most of your game sifting through the answers. With practice, both creating a questionnaire and character can become easy and rewarding parts of the game, though it may seem daunting at first.</p>
=======
<h2>Creating a Questionaire</h2>
<p>Creating questionnaires is more art than science. You will have to take into account the needs of the story, your players, and the characters themselves. Each requires something different from the questions. The story needs leading questions that tie the characters into the plot and each other and questions that can help the characters through some foreseeable hardships or expose them to greater danger. The players need questions that they can sink their teeth into, which lead to interesting answers and inspire them to breathe life into their characters. These create characters the players can invest themselves in—characters worth caring about. Without this investment, the players simply won’t care if they lose their characters. And the characters need questions that can flesh them out, defining their strengths and limits. The characters need to have their capabilities well defined in the questionnaire to avoid slowing down play with discussions on just what the character can and cannot do. Above all, the characters need a reason for hope, or they won’t care if they are lost to a tumbling tower.</p>

<p>Ask questions that deal with a character’s habits and daily life. Ask questions about occupations, hobbies, achievements, and goals. Ask questions about disabilities, weaknesses, addictions, and failures. Find out what shames a character, what excites a character, and always what a character fears.</p>

<p>Perhaps the one thing that every character questionnaire must address is why the character participates in the story. What is it about this character that keeps him or her from quitting? There will be moments in most <dread>Dread</dread> games when a character has the chance to turn tail on their friends and escape whatever horror they face. It may occur while trying to out run a fearsome and spectral predator or when the characters uncover a cache of medical supplies with a surplus of morphine. Why not let the ghostly beast consume your allies? Why not inject yourself with enough narcotics to forget it all? What is it that keeps the character in the game?</p>

<flesh>
<h2>Topics that Could Be Addressed in a Questionnaire</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do you behave?</li>
<li>How do you look?</li>
<li>How do you relate to the other characters?</li>
<li>What are your fears?</li>
<li>What are your habits?</li>
<li>What are your hobbies?</li>
<li>What are your strengths?</li>
<li>What are your weaknesses?</li>
<li>What do you do for a living?</li>
<li>What do you own?</li>
<li>What gives you courage?</li>
<li>What is your past?</li>
<li>What keeps you from giving up?</li>
<li>What makes you happy?</li>
<li>What makes you sad?</li>
<li>What is your name?</li>
</ul>
</flesh>

<flesh>
<h2>Intrusive Questions</h2>
<p>The most efficient way to get to the core of a character is to offer at least one intrusive question. These are the questions that no one is comfortable answering in real life. Many times these questions will never come up during the game; but they offer an incredible hook for the players, and for that reason, they are invaluable. Here are some samples. Some of them could be defused with easy answers, but players should be encouraged to seek the harder truths about their characters.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the worst thing you have ever done to a loved one?</li>
<li>It is said that everyone has a price—how did you discover yours?</li>
<li>Why are you married if you aren’t in love?</li>
<li>Why won’t your family acknowledge your existence?</li>
<li>Who else knows you are a fraud?</li>
<li>How come you no longer allow yourself to have pets?</li>
<li>Why do you feel responsible for the loss of a loved one?</li>
<li>Who has hurt you most over the years and why do you deserve it?</li>
</ul>
</flesh>
===============
<flesh>
<h2>Suggested Questionnaire Structure</h2>
<p>Ultimately, how you structure your questionnaire should reflect what works best for you and your players. This can be done differently for each questionnaire. There are times, however, when having a predefined structure can help you come up with questions faster and without worrying about leaving anything out. Here is one such structure. Feel free to make your own or disregard the idea of structures altogether.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask about a job, career, or some other defining trait.
   <ul><li>This should address the bulk of what the character is capable of and it should include some sort of hook that allows the character to be different than others with the same career</li></ul></li>
<li>Ask about another skill or talent such as a hobby or sport.</li>
<li>Ask for a psychological deficiency or dependency.
   <ul><li>This doesn’t have to be drastic, and in fact could just be something quirky about the character.</li></ul></li>
<li>Ask for a reason to find courage or hope.</li>
<li>Ask how this character relates to the others.</li>
<li>Ask about personality or appearance.</li>
<li>Ask about a relative or loved one.</li>
<li>Ask for a fear.</li>
<li>Ask about religion, politics, or worldview.</li>
<li>Ask about gear, favorite possessions, or wealth.</li>
<li>Ask for a weakness or vulnerability.</li>
<li>Ask for a survival technique or ability.
   <ul><li>This doesn’t have to be positive. Many people survive by avoiding problems in self-destructive ways.</li></ul></li>
<li>Ask for a name.</li>
</ul>
</flesh>

<p>After all, if the character doesn’t want to be in the game, the player might as well topple the tower and be done with it.</p>

<p>If you are building a game with certain types of characters in mind, ask leading questions that tie characters to the motives, careers, or social standings that you require. What did you steal from your employer just before you were fired? What is it about your love life that you fear your mother may discover? With all this cash, how do you fend off boredom? Each of these questions immediately says something about the character, but doesn’t exactly tell the whole story. Leave room for surprises.</p>

<p>That bears repeating: leave room for surprises. Try to leave as many important details as possible about the character up to the player. If you need someone who starts the game in a hospital, let the player decide whether they are a janitor, nurse, security guard, paramedic, pharmacist, doctor, patient, a loved one visiting a patient, or what have you. The key is to let go of control. Perhaps the player in the above example wants to play a mafia button-man who is looking to put the squeeze on an ill witness in protective custody. This opens up all new possibilities for the game. What if, during an outbreak of a horribly contagious and fatal disease, a police officer recognizes him and tries to apprehend him? The answers players come up with often add whole new layers of pressure on the character.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid of leaving questions open-ended. Ultimately, it is up to the host whether or not to approve any answer a player puts on a questionnaire. This way, the questionnaire can ask “You have mystical control over what?” and the player won’t be able to answer “The world,” unless the host wants to allow that answer.</p>
===========
<p>Through the questionnaire, you can leave some details of the story up to the players. “What feral animal almost killed you when you were a child, and how does this encounter still stay with you?” In a game where the antagonist is a lycanthrope, the answer to the question could prove very useful. The more details you draw out of the characters’ questionnaires, the easier it is to draw them into the story.</p>

<p>There is really no hard and fast rule on how many of which types of questions you should use in a questionnaire, but as a general guideline, a baker’s dozen or so should be enough. To make things easy on you, try to spend equal time on the character’s capabilities, shortcomings, personality and appearance, psychology, and social interactions with the other characters. It is also recommended that you include a question or two about what belongings they might have with them at the beginning of the story and of course, don’t forget to ask about the name.</p>

<p>Remember, though, the more questions you ask, the more you will have to read through to find that important detail in the middle of the game.</p>

<p>If you are having trouble thinking of questions, you will find over a hundred and fifty examples along the bottoms of these pages. Simply flip through the book to a random page and see if any of the questions inspire you. If not, look at the next or previous one, and see if the combination sparks an idea.</p>

<h2>Sample Questionnaire from a Risen Dead Game</h2>
<p>Here is an example questionnaire to examine—later we will look at how these questions can be answered. These are from a game that takes place a month or two after the dead have risen and torn the civilized world apart. Since this apocalypse, the characters have been forced into a grim and harsh survival.</p>

<p>This particular questionnaire was written with the intent to exemplify the differences between life before the apocalypse and after.</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="question">1. Before the apocalypse, what job did you hold at a dot-com company, and what did you enjoy most about it?</p>
<p>It is often a good idea to start off with a question that addresses the broadest details about the character. Here we have asked about the character’s previous job and what special skills they might have possessed at the job. This will give the player a chance to illustrate some of the character’s abilities as well as provide a framework from which the other questions can be answered.</p>

<p class="question">2. How do you think the others treat you differently because you are the youngest in the group other than the child?</p>
<p>When the players begin this particular game, their characters will have already known each other. Questions like these help define the relationships between the characters, so the players know where to start. They can also help to create friendships or rivalries among the players’ characters. Also, this question establishes some facts about the group, such as the presence of a child and the relative age of this character. The host of this game wanted everyone to know about the child right away because the child could be used to hold the group together.</p>

<p class="question">3. What drug are you now addicted to and why do you keep it a secret?</p>
<p>Questionnaires should address the faults of the characters as well as their strengths. In this particular game, the host wanted to make the stark new reality and its affects on the human psyche a central theme. The questionnaire reflects this by giving most of the questions a psychoanalytical edge. The hope is that the players will spend time considering how the rise of the dead has affected their characters’ lives.</p>
==========
<p class="question">4. Is the emotional impact of the apocalypse lightened by the fact that you are now more physically fit than you ever have been, or do you feel guilty for taking pleasure in this fact?</p>
<p>Like the previous question, this one deals with how the character’s psychology has changed since the rising of the dead. It also gives the player something else to work with if a physically demanding task comes up during the story—very handy in a game that will most likely involve a lot of running.</p>

<p class="question">5. When you have trouble sleeping, what pleasant memory do you focus on?</p>
<p>The host created this question in order to provide something hopeful or light-hearted in what would otherwise be a grim life. The goal was to subtly give the player a reason for the character to continue in this harsh world. Some players may need more than this to work with. If that was the case, the host could have asked the more obvious question: “What memories do you have that give you hope for the future?” There is nothing inherently wrong with either question—it just depends on the player. If, as a host, you are unsure, err on the obvious side for a question this important.</p>

<p class="question">6. Of all the family members and friends you lost to the dead in the first few days of the apocalypse, whom do you miss the most and why?</p>
<p>Questions about the past, especially concerning regrets, fears, or lost loved ones, are always good. They help to flesh out the character and they provide fuel for horrific encounters in the course of the story. In this case, the host was toying with the idea of having an apparition haunt the players’ characters. If each character had a similar question, the host could pick the most effective one.</p>

<p class="question">7. Do you let the others know about that thrill you get from the adrenaline rush that accompanies a battle with the dead, and how does this rush affect how you fight?</p>
<p>This is another hint that this character could become a physical powerhouse. The host is expecting the players’ characters to be fighting the dead for a good chunk of the story. Questions like these will not only help the characters survive, but will help the host decide on what may or may not require pulls while the characters are engaged in battle.</p>

<p class="question">8. You depend on the others for survival because of your lack of what vital ability?</p>
<p>Like the question about the drug addiction, this one forces the player to explore some of the character’s weaknesses. Players can sometimes be reluctant to see their character in a negative light, which makes these questions vital. Perhaps more importantly, this question gives the character a reason to stick with the group and help everyone survive, something this host wants to encourage.</p>

<p class="question">9. Whom do you feel closest to in the group and who do you believe doesn’t like you?</p>
<p>This is the third question that deals with relations with other players’ characters and the group dynamic. Not all games will need this many, but this time the host wanted to focus on reasons why the characters would look out for each other. It also creates a little tension, which is perfectly fine. When answering this sort of question, it is recommended that the player wait until everyone is ready to introduce their characters to everyone else. It will then be easier to find a character that matches each part of the question.</p>

<p class="question">10. What’s in your pockets?</p>
Rarely do characters begin the game naked, and there is a reasonable amount of items that could be assumed a character would have, even if they weren’t listed on the questionnaire. But questions like this one allow the players to introduce unique and perhaps vital items. As with all the answers on a questionnaire, the host has to approve this one, just to make sure a stray assault rifle doesn’t find its way into a story set in the fog-choked alleys of Victorian London.</p>
===========
<p class="question">11. What part of yourself do you find most embarrassing?</p>
<p>The answer to this question will give the player a way to play the character in a social role. If the answer is a physical feature, such a large nose, everyone will have a better idea of what the character looks like. If the answer is something else, such as the character’s inability to speak to members of the opposite gender or the character’s age, then this will most certainly come out during play when the character is interacting socially.</p>

<p class="question">12. What do you think you are better at than you really are?</p>
<p>The answer to this question will not only provide the host with something to trap the character with, it will also give the character’s player more to work with in social situations. But mostly, it is just a fun question and will generate entertaining moments in the game.</p>

<p class="question">13. What is your name?</p>
<p>Finally, the player is asked to provide a name for the character.</p>
</div>

<h2>Filling Out a Questionnaire</h2>
<p>When filling out a character questionnaire, you should always assume the presence of a silent “and why?” at the end of each question. It will create a better understanding of the character. The answer will cover more ground, and there will be less room for misunderstanding during the game itself. The more times you ask yourself “and why?” about any of the questions, the further and further you fall into the depths of the character. To take a seemingly innocuous question and apply an exaggerated example:</p>

<p>“What’ll you have to drink?” Whiskey, on the rocks. “Why?” Because I’m a weary man with little use for frivolous and fruity drinks. “Why?” Because I have seen things that have made me question my own sanity. “Why?” It is the nature of my occupation to scour the world for things we were not meant to know. And so forth.</p>

<p>You do not have to answer all of the silent whys in print, but considering them will help you answer other questions.</p>

<p>The goal to filling out a questionnaire is not to create a character that will survive and thrive in any environment the host throws at you, but to create an interesting character that makes the story worth participating in. To this end, consider what sorts of flaws your character will have to heroically overcome, and try to bring them out in your answers. Try to provide reasons for why your character would want to survive the story and make connections with the other characters. The game is a struggle and without such reasons and connections, there is no point in playing. Keep in mind that whatever answers you supply will have to be approved by the host.</p>

<marrow>
<h2>How to Answer the Questions
<p>To create an appropriate character, try to follow these tips when filling out a questionnaire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume the question ends with a few more “and why?” or “How?” questions.</li>
<li>Don’t try to make an invincible character.</li>
<li>Tie your character in with the other characters.
   <ul><li>You can wait until all the characters are introduced before you answer the questions about the other characters.</li></ul></li>
<li>Create a character with flaws that need to be overcome.</li>
<li>Give your character a reason to survive.</li>
<li>Most of all, create a character you want to play.</li>
</ul>
</marrow>
=================
<p>If you are stuck on the answer to a certain question, move on and return to it later, or ask the host for clarification. You may also find that you will have to wait for details about the other characters as well. For that matter, other players may ask you about your character. If all the players are present, you can go ahead and ask them. Alternatively, everyone may decide to wait until the rest of the questionnaires are filled out, introduce their characters, and then answer the interpersonal questions. There is no need to share information you do not feel the other characters would or should know. Try to be as helpful as possible without revealing any important character secrets.</p>

<h2>Sample Answers from a Risen Dead Game</h2>
<p>Here is one example of how a player might fill out the sample questionnaire from above. The comments are interspersed, and explain why these answers are useful and how they may help in the game.</p>

<div class="example">
<p class="question">1. Before the apocalypse, what job did you hold at a dot-com company, and what did you enjoy most about it?</p>
<p class="answer">I was a database programmer working on correlating large amounts of data about the shopping habits of our customers’ customers. You couldn’t imagine a less exciting job. Debugging was about the only thing that kept me alive. I love that investigative shit.</p>
<p>Answering in first person may help a player get a feel for the character’s voice, which seems to have happened here. The debugging comment indicates that the character has an affinity for methodical detective work, which may come into play during the story.</p>

<p class="question">2. How do you think the others treat you differently because you are the youngest in the group other than the child?</p>
<p class="answer">Not too differently now, I made damn sure of that.</p>
<p>While this answer appears to go against the spirit of the question, it is not altogether a bad answer. The player’s conception of the character does not include him being fawned upon, ignored, or patronized, and this is made clear in the answer. Plus, it still gives the character some depth by implying that there was a time in the past when this was an issue. Since the host didn’t feel that it was essential to the story that this character be treated differently, this answer was approved.</p>

<p class="question">3. What drug are you now addicted to and why do you keep it a secret?</p>
<p class="answer">Nicotine. Smoking is a filthy habit, and I don’t want the child picking it up. I’m pretty sure the child thinks of me as a big brother.</p>
<p>This answer is a good example of answering the silent “and why?” at the end. The question requires that the player write at least the first two sentences, but the third brings the idea together and offers a relationship that would be interesting to play. The child isn’t named or even given a gender in this answer because the player who is playing the child’s parent hasn’t filled out that questionnaire yet. The player can fill that information in later, if necessary.</p>

<p class="question">4. Is the emotional impact of the apocalypse lightened by the fact that you are now more physically fit than you ever have been, or do you feel guilty for taking pleasure in this fact?</p>
<p class="answer">Both. It is survival of the fittest and I make no excuses for delighting in my survival, but deep down, I’m afraid it is just bravado.</p>
<p>There isn’t much wiggle room in this question for the player. Obviously the host wanted the character to be physically fit and wanted the character to be concerned about it. With questions like these the important part is just to consider how it affects your understanding of the character.</p>
===========
<p class="question">5. When you have trouble sleeping, what pleasant memory do you focus on?</p>
<p class="answer">Christmas time. Hopefully we will be able to celebrate the holiday again.</p>
<p>This is another example of the player supplying more than is asked for. Goals like this one are also great ways to give your character a reason to keep going in the face of the horrors they will experience.</p>

<p class="question">6. Of all the family members and friends you lost to the dead in the first few days of the apocalypse, whom do you miss the most and why?</p>
<p class="answer">My little sister. We always stuck up for each when we were growing up, and I feel personally responsible for losing her. Perhaps this is why I care so much for the child.</p>
<p>Another opportunity to make a connection with the child, which is great, but this answer actually brings up more questions. In this case the host asks the player to provide a little more information on the sister.</p>
<p class="answer">She’s four and half years younger than me and had just started college when the dead rose. Her name was Carol, but we called her Carl because she would mispronounce her own name as a child.</p>

<p class="question">7. Do you let the others know about that thrill you get from the adrenaline rush that accompanies a battle with the dead, and how does this rush affect how you fight?</p>
<p class="answer">I’m too vocal about the thrill during the fight—always shouting insults that fall on dead ears. Afterwards, however, I deny the thrill and try to pretend I am more somber than I really am. I prefer to fight up close with the dead. They can’t sneak up on you if you are in the middle of them.</p>
<p>Much like the answer to the fourth question, this answer makes for a complex and rich personality. The character isn’t just a dead-destroying machine. He has fears, both of being surprised by the dead and of being exposed as enjoying this too much.</p>

<p class="question">8. You depend on the others for survival because of your lack of what vital ability?</p>
<p class="answer">Acquiring and preparing food. I just can’t get the hang of hunting, foraging, and cooking.</p>
<p>The host may point out to the player that because the dead only rose months ago, there is still plenty of canned goods to be scavenged from abandoned houses and stores. But the character is already tied pretty firmly to the group through the child, and eating nothing but canned goods will eventually wear on him. So this answer should work.</p>

<p class="question">9. Whom do you feel closest to in the group and who do you believe doesn’t like you?</p>
<p>At this point, the player leaves this blank and plans on answering it once everyone has been introduced.</p>

<p class="question">10. What’s in your pockets?</p>
<p class="answer">A Swiss army knife, a Leatherman multi-tool, a lucky silver dollar, a lighter, two packs of cigarettes, and <s>a .45 magnum with extra clip</s>.</p>
<p>The host approves all of these items except for the gun. While it is conceivable that these survivors would have guns, the player already indicated that the character preferred to fight in close quarters. The two of them discuss the matter and decide to list a machete instead, which fits better with both their understandings of the character—even if it doesn’t fit in a pocket.</p>
<p class="answer">And I always carry a machete with me.</p>
=============
<p class="question">11. What part of yourself do you find most embarrassing?</p>
<p class="answer">My body odor. Rarely do we get the chance to maintain the same level of hygiene we all had before the dead rise, but I’m sure I’ve suffered the worst for it. Whenever possible, I avoid standing too close to the others, for their sake.</p>
<p>An answer like this not only gives the player another hook when it comes to playing the character, but it gives the host a chance to put this character in some awkward situations. What if all of the characters were held up in a closet, hoping that a roving band of dead will pass them by? Whether or not this character actually smells, will he be embarrassed enough to face the dead alone just to give the others some fresh air?</p>

<p class="question">12. What do you think you are better at than you really are?</p>
<p class="answer">Stealth. I simply don’t realize how much noise I make.</p>
<p>Another answer that should give the host ideas for what to throw at the players.</p>

<p class="question">13. What is your name?</p>
<p class="answer">Chuckles.</p>
<p>The host felt such a silly name might detract from the game, and asked the player if he thought it was appropriate. The player decided it was a nickname.</p>
<p class="answer">Charles “Chuckles” Thompson.</p>

<h2>Playing your Character</h2>
<p>Once you have completed the questionnaire it is time to introduce your character to the other players. At this point, you should reveal any information their characters may know about yours. Just how much usually depends on the characters’ relationship with each other. The host should let everyone know if and how they know each other. Answers to questions about character relationships will also have an impact. In the end, you should play by ear and makes sure you don’t reveal anything that is meant to be a secret. Those can come out during the game.</p>

<p>Generally, the host will start the game by telling you and the other players about where their characters are, what they have been doing just before the game started, and what the world about them looks, sounds, feels, and smells like. While the host narrates the story, you and your fellow players should explain what your characters are doing. There is no order to this unless the host says that there needs to be. Try to give everyone an opportunity to participate, but don’t sit back and let the story happen without you. Jump in.</p>

<p>During the game, you will be responsible for controlling your character’s intentions. You can decide exactly what the character wants to do and how the character plans on doing it. However, things will not always go according to plan. From time to time the host may step in and require that you pull some blocks in order for your character to do what you want your character to do. Or, if the host thinks whatever your character is attempting is too unreasonable, it may be prohibited altogether. When the host makes these sorts of judgments, you are allowed to argue your character’s case, to a point. If you feel that the host has overlooked an ability that is clearly detailed on the questionnaire, or if you don’t think the host fully understands how the character will accomplish the task at hand, you are welcome to bring these things up. Ultimately, the host is the final arbiter. If you state your case and the host still disagrees, you must live with their ruling.</p>

<p>There are two reasons why the host’s rulings on character actions are final. The first is simply to save time and eliminate stress. Lengthy arguments about what imaginary people can and can’t do are no fun to anyone. The second is because the host knows more-intimate details about the story. You may think that because your character is a professional mechanic, she should be able to fix the getaway car in no time flat; but you won’t realize until much later in the story that an alien virus is clouding her brain. The host shouldn’t have to reveal such details until the appropriate time, so as a player you will have to trust the host’s judgment.</p>
=============
<p>When playing your character, keep the questionnaire on hand so you can reference it. Try to speak as your character would (though if your character has a voice too far removed from your own, no one will blame you if you speak normally instead of in a comical pitch or accent). Playing a <dread>Dread</dread> game is in some ways similar to improvisational theater. Everyone is more likely to enjoy the game if they are in character. Keep in mind what is written on your questionnaire. There will be opportunities to showcase behaviors and quirks that were developed from the answers you came up with.</p>

<p>Remember to stay as true to your character as possible. Don’t consider what you would do in any given situation; consider what your character would do.</p>

<h2>Player vs. Character</h2>
<p>When you know somethingthat your character should not, you need to pretend you don’t know it. Or rather, you must not play the character as if they know it. This is much harder than it sounds. The game isn’t ruined if you forget to maintain this separation of knowledge, but you should try to be aware of it. For the most part, it can be assumed that characters know many of the everyday things that their players know. That is, assuming the game is set in roughly the same time and culture as the players. If you were playing serfs in feudal Europe who are being hunted by a demented lord and his entourage, then obviously your characters would not know how to change the tires on a car. Fortunately, this situation is not likely to rise in such a game.</p>

<flesh>
<h2>Helping the Host</h2>
<p>When you fill out your character’s questionnaire there will be several opportunities for you to help the host out. Mainly, you want to make your character’s abilities and drawbacks as clear as possible. This way there will be less discussion about what the character can and can’t do during play.</p>

<p>You will also want to give your character the sort of flaws that will lead to interesting dilemmas in the game. This not only gives the host something to work with, but also allows you to control a bit of the story you want to tell with your character.</p>

<p>Finally, you want to make a character that will interact with the other characters. This interaction doesn’t have to be positive all the time, but there needs to be a reason for the character to be with them. For some games, this will be obvious—everyone is trapped in the same haunted asylum trying to find their way out. For others it may require a little more help from the players. Everything will run more smoothly in these games if you create a character that has a reason to work with or use the group.</p>
