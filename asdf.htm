<p>Dread is a horror game. There is no reason that the content of any game of Dread need be any more horrifying than you wish it to be, and therefore Dread can be suitable for nearly any age. However, the contents of this book delve into mature topics at points, in order to facilitate groups who enjoy those sorts of horror, so please exercise discretion when passing this book around. In particular, <a href="chapter11.htm">Chapter 11</a> is not suitable for our younger players.</p>
