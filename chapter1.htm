<h1 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: To Begin With</h1>
<p class="introFlav">I remember watching the mugs as I gingerly attempted to carry the coffee to the bereaved, without spilling it on their immaculate living room carpet. Within a breath, the steam disappeared and the dark fluid frosted over. A chill crept across my neck and I looked up to see poor, little Lucy standing just outside the window. For a moment it all seemed a horrible mistake. It was not her body the police found alongside that hateful highway. She had simply been lost, as we first suspected, and just now found her way home.</p>
<p class="introFlav">I was about to relay the good news to the Kohlmans and the reverend when I saw their faces blanch as they stared at me … rather, just beyond me. That was when I realized that it wasn’t Lucy outside, but her reflection against the darkened window. Soon I would learn that both the police and I were correct. That was Lucy’s body in the ditch, and she did indeed find her way home.</p>

<p><span class="initCap">D</span><span class="dread">read</span> is a game of horror and hope. Those who play will participate in a mutual telling of an original macabre tale. The goal of <span class="dread">Dread</span> is to sustain the delicate atmosphere that invokes the hand-quivering emotion that lends its name to the game.</p>

<p>The thrill of a <span class="dread">Dread</span> game lies within the tension between desire and loss. You will take on the role of people trapped in a story that is only as compelling as it is hostile—people who will find themselves making decisions we hope never to face in real life.</p>

<h2>The Warning</h2>
<p>So, it should be said that <span class="dread">Dread</span> is not necessarily for everyone. The main purpose of any game is to have fun. Like a good game of Truth or Dare, <span class="dread">Dread</span> should make you uncomfortable from time to time. If this does not sound like fun, then please do not play.</p>

<p>If, however, you crave a game that savors alienation, tension, anxiety, fear, and all those other delicious emotions that draw an audience of millions to horror novels, stories, comics, and movies each year, then by all means, enjoy.</p>

<h2>The Basics</h2>
<p>During a <span class="dread">Dread</span> game
you and your friends
will create characters to populate your own brand of horror story. It may take several hours to accomplish this, or even several nights, and it will require some preparation. Within this book you will find a set of rules and guidelines that will help you with this endeavor. However, it is important that you remember the ultimate goal is the story itself. If any part of this book or its contents gets in the way, feel free to ignore or alter it as you see fit.</p>

<p>To play, you will need yourself and at least one other person, though it is recommended that you gather about five to six players in total. The majority of you will be playing the roles of characters caught in a tale of horror—one character to a player. One of you will have the fortune (fair or foul) to host the game. Who among you shall take up this mantle is a choice for your group to make. All players have responsibilities in the game, but the host’s duties are unique. The host will create the basic framework for the story and will be the arbiter of all the conflicts the characters find themselves in. The host will also take on the roles of all the other characters that aren’t played by the other players. Because the duties of the host are slightly more involved, the majority of this book is dedicated to them.</p>

<h2>The Tower</h2>
<p>The tower is a pile of fifty-four 1”x½”x3” wooden blocks stacked three to a level, in alternating directions, eighteen levels high, that can be purchased commercially under the brand name Jenga®. If you do not already own this fairly ubiquitous game, it is readily available in the game and toy sections of most stores. If you wish to create your own, we encourage you to experiment with your own dimensions and send us photos of the completed set.</p></div>

<p>In addition to players, you will need a sturdy, flat surface; plenty of scratch paper; pens or pencils; and the tower (see sidebar and the next chapter). It may also be useful to have this book handy—at least for the first few times you play. Eventually, once your group finds its particular style and rhythm, you will find this book useless. In fact, it can become a hindrance if you are constantly referencing it. Once that happens, we encourage you to pass it on.</p>

<h2>The Ambience</h2>
<p>When you are ready to play, you will want to set aside a sufficient amount of time and meet at an appropriate place. To maintain a horrific atmosphere you should begin with the proper environment. A dark, quiet place will work best. You will need light enough to read by, but little more. You may wish for some mood music. Try to avoid anything with obtrusive lyrics, keep the volume low, and make sure you bring enough to avoid it becoming repetitive. Since many <span class="dread">Dread</span> games can take four or more hours, this may take some planning. The key to making both the lighting and the music work is to keep it subdued. Don’t let them detract from the game itself. Candles can add to the atmosphere, but avoid placing them on the same surface as the tower or where someone may knock them over. You may also want to have food and drink handy, so the game isn’t interrupted by a quest to sate such carnal desires.</p>

<h2>The Book</h2>
<p>Throughout these rules you will happen upon two different sidebars: the marrow and the flesh. Both serve to clarify concepts in the game but do so in their own fashion. The marrow is meant to be a quick reference, a distillation of the contents of the page. The text is repeated in simplified language to make it easier to find the foundations of the rules during play or a swift search of the book. The flesh will expand on the page’s content, offering examples, insight, or other materials. They exist to develop the basic concepts in the rules in ways that should assist you in understanding them.</p>

<p>The rules in the next ten chapters are divided into three sections. The next two chapters (Briefly, the Rules and A Question of Character) are a basic overview of rules that all players should have some familiarity with. The fourth and fifth chapters (How to Host a <span class="dread">Dread</span> Game and How to Create a <span class="dread">Dread</span> Game) are dedicated entirely to the tasks of the host, and most players need not bother with them. The final six chapters are also aimed at the host, but may not be pertinent to every <span class="dread">Dread</span> game. They are a collection of tips and guidelines that will assist the host in using various common horrific themes and elements in his stories. Finally, there is an appendix covering alternatives to Jenga®, and then three ready-to-run <span class="dread">Dread</span> scenarios.</p>
